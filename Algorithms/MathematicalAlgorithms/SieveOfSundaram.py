        sieve of Sundaram is a variant of the sieve of Eratosthenes, a simple deterministic algorithm for finding all the prime numbers up to a specified integer.

        If we start with integers from 1 to n, the final list contains only odd integers from 3 to 2n+1.
        From this final list, some odd integers have been excluded;
        we must show these are precisely the composite odd integers less than 2n + 2.

        Let q be an odd integer of the form 2k + 1. Then, q is excluded if and only if k is of the form i + j + 2ij, that is q = 2(i + j + 2ij) + 1. Then we have:

        q = 2(i + j + 2ij) + 1
        q = 2i + 2j + 4ij + 1
        q = (2i + 1)(2j + 1)
        So, an odd integer is excluded from the final list if and only if it has a factorization of the form (2i + 1)(2j + 1) â€” which is to say,
        if it has a non-trivial odd factor. Therefore the list must be composed of exactly the set of odd prime numbers less than or equal to 2n + 2.
