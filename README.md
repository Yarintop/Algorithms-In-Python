# Data Structures And Algorithms In Python

**This is a WIP and not finished in the slightest.**

I've made this repository in order to learn new data structures and algorithms as well as practice the ones I did know, and what a better way is there than implementing them.

I've used various sources which are credited in each section, but I've mainly used [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) as a reference point and for the order of the algorithms.
